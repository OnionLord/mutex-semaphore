This project aims at showing the difference between a binary semaphore and a    mutex.
What I am doing here is a simple producer/consumer problem with two pthreads.
In one example, namely mutex, I'll be using mutex to synchronize the access and then I'll show how that leads to a disaster.
The next one, I'll show how using a semaphore as if it was a mutex will cause   the same problem if not worse
Finally, I'll use the semaphore the right way to signal between the threads what to be done.

On compilation:
This project was compiled using gcc 4.6.3 on a Linux machine running 3.2.0 64bit
Compile it with:
gcc <file_name> -o <executable_name> -lpthread

Final note:
The error code checking is intentionally left, this is not a production code and is aimed only to teach a concept about semaphores/mutexes thus the error checking was removed for clarity's sake
